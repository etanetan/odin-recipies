    <h1>Egg In A Hole</h1>
    <img src="../images/egginahole.jpeg" alt="Egg In a Hole recipe finished.">
    <h3>This is a recipe to make the classic egg in a hole meal that tastes so great!</h3>
    <p>This is my <em>favorite</em> recipe for making eggs. You get a good amount of fats, carbs, and protein.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons bacon grease</li>
        <li>1 slice bread</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the bacon grease in a non-stick pan over low heat.</li>
        <li>When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm.</li>
        <li>Flip again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
